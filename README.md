For Oolite

An oxp adding the opportunity to visit a station bar and overhear some useful advice for success in Oolite

Presuming that I can get this to work (ha!), I'd like to add choices of drinks, and then add GNN newsflashes to amplify a little more along these lines. This is currently little more than a cut & paste of LittleBear's suggestions. It does not work: the F4 screen shows no sign of a bar of any sort whatsoever!

Notes on License: I'm no jolly good at this sort of thing and will probably fail dismally. If you pick up this ball and run with it, some token of acknowledgement would be nice, but is not necessary. Just do a better job than I did!

This is not showing up on the F4 screen.
List of simple oxp's with presence on the F4 screen:
Planner: uses different mechanism
Station Self-Destruction Codes: no mechanism at all: magic!
OoCheat?
Market Inquirer?
Commanders Log?
Communications Log?
Laser Arrangement?
Shipâ€™s Library?
