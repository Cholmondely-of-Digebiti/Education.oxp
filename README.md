For Oolite

An oxp adding the opportunity to visit a station bar and overhear some useful advice for success in Oolite

Presuming that I can get this to work (ha!), I'd like to add choices of drinks, and then add GNN newsflashes to amplify a little more along these lines. This is currently little more than a cut & paste of LittleBear's suggestions. It does not yet work - just the one message with a bar picture. And not even that if you have XenonUI installed!

Notes on License: I'm no jolly good at this sort of thing and will probably fail dismally. If you pick up this ball and run with it, some token of acknowledgement would be nice, but is not necessary. Just do a better job than I did!

Can't yet get the full selection of discussions from the descriptions.plist
