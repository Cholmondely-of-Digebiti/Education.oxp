For Oolite

An oxp adding the opportunity to visit a station bar and overhear some useful advice for success in Oolite.

Help from Montana05 & phkb. 
Inspiration (and bar picture) from BeeTLe BeTHLeHeM

Note: Editing some things on GitHub seems undoable. I can't work out how to remove the word "copy" from the .oxp folder title, nor how to move the descriptions.plist inside the config folder.

Future plans: I'd like to add choices of drinks, and then add GNN newsflashes to amplify a little more along these lines. Also to add variation and choice in bars (those orbital stations are massive). I'd also like to "include it" in BeeTLe BeTHLeHeM's Life in the Frontier.oxp

Notes on License: I'm no jolly good at this sort of thing and only managed thanks to the help of others. If you pick up this ball and run with it, some token of acknowledgement would be nice, but is not necessary. Just make sure that you do a better job than I did!
