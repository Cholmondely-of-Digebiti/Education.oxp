Note: Editing some things on GitHub seems undoable. I can't work out how to remove the word "copy" from the .oxp folder title, nor how to move the descriptions.plist inside the config folder.

Future thoughts: 
1) I'd like to add choices of drinks, and possibly add GNN newsflashes to amplify a little more along these lines. 
2) Also to add variation and choice in bars (those orbital stations are massive, just one bar is unrealistic). 
3) I'd also like to "include it" in BeeTLe BeTHLeHeM's Life in the Frontier.oxp
4) I desperately want to add in advice for oxp's (which requires this to recognise which oxp's are loaded and then dole out data accordingly)

Notes on License: I'm no jolly good at this sort of thing and only managed thanks to the help of others. If you pick up this ball and run with it, some token of acknowledgement would be nice, but is not necessary. Just make sure that you do a better job than I did!
