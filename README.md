For Oolite

An oxp adding the opportunity to visit a station bar and overhear some useful advice for success in Oolite

Notes on License: I'm no jolly good at this sort of thing and will probably fail dismally. If you pick up this ball and run with it, some token of acknowledgement would be nice, but is not necessary. Just do a better job than I did!
